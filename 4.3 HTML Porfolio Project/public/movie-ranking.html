        <h3>Fantasy: Harry Potter series</h3>
            <p>
                Rating: 5/5 <br/>
                Out of all the fantasy stories and
                movies, the wizarding world is the
                most imaginative and the one I want
                to live in the most.

        <h3>Horror: The Pope's Exorcist</h3>
            <p>
                Rating: 5/5 <br/>
                This horror movie follows logical
                action and it is true heroic evil
                fighting. Avoids cheap scares and
                digusting material.

        <h3>Sci-Fi: Ready Player One</h3>
            <p>
                Rating: 4/5 <br/>
                All out 80's extravaganza, but the
                book is honestly just better.
